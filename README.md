## Hack the Change 2023 🫳

## Overview

Welcome to our project for Hack the Change 2023! We are providing a platform that makes the donation of children's clothing easy and accessible, while also encouraging the reuse of the clothes as well. It appeals to both those who want to give back and those who seek a more sustainable alternative. 👶
